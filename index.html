            <p>
              Happy birthday my love!<br>
              I'm so sorry it took so long to make this. This hurt my head and was hard to figure out how to make.<br>
              I was afraid you were going to get angry cause you said "ok". I'm sorry I didn't answer when you asked what it was, I didn't want to spoil it for you hehe.<br>
              Anyway, Happy birthday again, my baby. I love you so much, and I hope that your day will be as beautiful and magical as you.<br>
              ❤️<br>
